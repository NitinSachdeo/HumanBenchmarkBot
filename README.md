Human Benchmark Bot
===================

This repository consists of a browser automation based python bot intended to be the
best there ever was on all the tests part of the
[Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/).

Please don't actually use this! I did this as a fun project to learn a bit about browser
automation and the human benchmark is a fun thing to try with your friends and not something
to flex about. Check out my results [here](https://humanbenchmark.com/users/5fa5c76b2862de00016b7b69), someday I'll get 95% in aim trainer... ðŸ˜¢
